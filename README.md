# klondike-AI
Klondike is the AI Open Source platform for CRM, ERP & eCommerce. 
Our goal is to democratize access to Artificial Intelligence, making it accessible and usable in a simple, fast and flexible way.
Thanks to our AI Algorithms Marketplace and a natively integrated Business Process Management Engine (BPM), companies of all sizes and industries can save time and easily automate their mechanical and repetitive tasks.
We chose to be an Open Source platform in order to create a community that can access the code, reuse it and contribute to our project. In this way, anyone can promote and facilitate our goal of democratization of Artificial Intelligence.

The basic languages of the Klondike platform are PHP, HTML, MySQL, Javascript, Python, Ruby e Bash Script
